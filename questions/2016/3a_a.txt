harry,

if jamelia was working on a scheme to weaponise earthquakes, then we need to know how far she had got. i have sent trinity in to work undercover in jamelia’s lab and tasked her to try to infiltrate dynamix from there. trinity isn’t too happy there, jamelia’s office isn’t much bigger than a broom closet, but we need to try to find the code base referred to in the hidden diary entry.

in the meantime, i have been working on the list of questions you and jamelia were asking. first: why did martin leave? according to his flatmate he flew to geneva for talks with a company called citadelle. our local agents are making enquiries, but it seems that they are that rarest of things, an established arms manufacturer with money worries. second: where is martin now? no-one knows. citadelle deny any knowledge of him, and there is no record of him leaving the country. he has disappeared.

the most intriguing thing from jamelia’s last message is the reference to the pds syndicate. i have heard rumours of this myself in whitehall. it is all very hush-hush and it is not even clear if it is an official initiative.

the big news for now is a breakthrough on the so called suicide note. given how small jamelia’s office was, trinity wondered why she had kept a broken printer in there next to the working one. trinity opened it up and found a few modifications which pointed the laser straight at the paper instead of the drum. she got in touch with the lab and got them to take another look at the letter. they found the attached message burned into the paper fibres. it is impossible to see with the naked eye, but the charring shows up under high powered fluoroscopy. over to you for the decryption.
