notes from interview with martin traynor
in attendance: mi, nsa and reps from nis

the suspect was carrying high quality identity documents in the name of james martin and claimed to be a drop out from a graduate programme in computer science in neuchatel. his story checked out with the university authorities.

analysis showed a high degree of correlation between the biometrics of the suspect and of martin traynor, but we did not reveal that we suspected james to be martin. he refused requests to provide a dna sample for analysis, stating that dna databases were a tool of oppression.

a search of the suspect’s belongings found no links with the uk at all despite the fact that voice characteristics suggest he spent a considerable amount of time there as a child. the suspect stated that he had left all that behind and was not prepared to talk about it.

taking care not to reveal what was already known about traynor’s relationship with the swiss bank, we turned to the suspect’s financial arrangements. at first he claimed to work entirely on a cash basis and not to have a bank account, but when pressed on this he could not or would not explain where he kept his cash reserve even when we pointed out that he appeared to be too well off for someone living hand to mouth.

pushing harder we revealed that we had footage of him in the lobby of a bank, and he claimed that he had visited on behalf of the collective as part of a phishing expedition on a freelance penetration test of the bank’s security. when challenged about the legality of this he claimed it was a white hat exercise and that no weaknesses had been found so no further action had been taken by the collective.

under further questioning however it became apparent that the suspect was talking about an entirely different bank from the swiss bank we had been monitoring. he seemed to believe that we had footage of him in an oslo branch. agents were sent to retrieve lobby footage of this bank and further analysis showed that his visits there tallied with the activities he described at interview. however, we also noticed that a woman matching dalmar’s description was often videoed at the same branch during the period under investigation.

when asked about this the suspect became highly agitated and repeatedly demanded to call his lawyer. we pointed out that it was unusual for a member of a hacking collective to have a lawyer on retainer, but the suspect refused to answer any more questions until he had been allowed to make the call. a call trace showed the mobile that he rang belonged to a law firm which works for the arms manufacturer citadelle.

the suspect was released on bail pending charges of conspiracy to engage in unauthorised access to computer technology at the bank and is being closely watched. all calls to and from the law firm are being monitored and the oslo bank is under twenty-four/seven surveillance.

conclusions:

we believe with near certainty that the suspect is martin traynor and that the woman in the footage is jamelia dalmar. we believe they are in communication with one another and are both being protected by citadelle or one of its subsidiaries. we believe that they are both living in or near oslo and that they are both now highly likely to be aware that the net is closing in. we do not understand how dalmar contrived to fake her death and we still do not have a clear picture of the interaction between the pds syndicate, dynamix and citadelle. nor do we fully understand why they have a strong interest in traynor and dalmar. we believe that some or all of that information may be contained in the encrypted files on traynor’s laptop which has been passed to forensics for analysis and to secure the data.
