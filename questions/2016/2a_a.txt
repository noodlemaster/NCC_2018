the note you sent over was trickier than i expected. jamelia didn't just reverse the whole message before encrypting it, she put all the punctuation and spacing back in the original places to throw the casual reader off the scent. it wasn't very sophisticated, but it was devious, and tells us something about the way she thinks. one thing i am certain about, this doesn't read like a suicide note. who writes one of those in code?

our field agent asked around at the university and was told that jamelia's boyfriend worked in the same lab as her for a while. his name is martin traynor and they both did an internship in their second year at a spinout company called dynamix. that is a small startup which works on the fringes of the arms industry, but no-one seems to know much about it.

i am not sure why dynamix would have hired jamelia; you said that she was working on gravity waves, which are a seismological phenomenon. i read an interesting paper called "gravity waves in earthquakes" which suggested that they might be responsible for the destruction of high rise blocks during some tremors. but unless dynamix are planning to try to weaponise earthquakes i am not sure why this would be of interest to them. we need to know more about her work and what they hired her to do.

there are a lot of questions even in the first note:

why did martin leave?
where is he?
why couldn't she get hold of him?
what was too big for jamelia to handle alone?
what made jamelia feel guilty?
how was she planning to fix it?

i am hoping that the attached document will answer some of these questions but it will probably just raise others. i found it pasted under the cover of the notebook that the previous message was taken from. i can see why the police missed it, though it wasn't a very professional job.
