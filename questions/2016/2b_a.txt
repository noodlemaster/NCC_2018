questions for martin,

why are citadelle interested in dynamix?
how did dynamix get my code-base?
what are dynamix planning to do with it?
why is he still involved with them?
who are the pds syndicate?

i think i know the answers, and i am pretty sure he must do too. the three months we spent working at dynamix were some of the most exciting i have ever experienced, but surely, knowing what we know now, even martin must have some reservations about working with these people.

i am not sure who to talk to about this. i am certain that some members of the board at dynamix are completely in the dark about it, no conspiracy with that many members could have survived more than a week, but i have no idea which of them i can trust. i thought i could trust martin, but that was before the pds hack.

i canÂ€™t talk to the police; special branch are certain to flag it given the names of some of the people on the board. with their connections who knows what might happen. the pds syndicate are too big for me to handle alone. they know almost everything about me, and i know next to nothing about them. if i stay here to fight, then it is only a matter of time until they realise i am on to them. if i havenÂ€™t disappeared before then, then i have a feeling they will make me disappear.
