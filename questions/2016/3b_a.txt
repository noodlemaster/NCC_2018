notes on dynamix citadelle the pds syndicate dynamix are a small company that relies on postgraduate interns for most of its good ideas the project we worked on for dynamix was signal recognition in a noisy environment citadelle is a major arms manufacturer that got left behind in the digital age and seems to be looking to buy its way back into the market by taking over smaller more nimble competitors after we left dynamix we were both approached by someone claiming to work for citadelle saying they were impressed by the work we did there and that they wouldbe interested in developing the code we wrote i told them where to go i thought martin was going to do the same but then he told me he wanted to talk with them he said that our code might beofinterestto powerful people and i thought he was trying to get me to join him and work with them now i think he was trying to warn me after martin disappeared i was approached by someone claiming to work for a government agency known as the pds syndicate they wouldnt tell me what they did or why they were interested but they wanted to know where martin had gone i have almost finished testing the latest version of the net it is better than any of the previous versions by several orders of magnitude and i havent tuned it yet i think it has real potential and i think that dynamix citadelle and the pds syndicate think that too i am afraid i think i need to hide i dont know where to run
