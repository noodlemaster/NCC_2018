well that was a surprise and quite a relief as i said before no one really knows where the hanginggardens of babylon were located and i dont think we would have had a chance of finding the next chapter if that was where it was buried but it seems that tacitus had a better idea the babylonian goddess of love and war was ishtar and the ishtar gate from babylon was one of the original seven wonders of the world it was later replaced by the light house of alexandria so i am not sure why tacitus used both but may be because he didnt know where the hanginggardens were either or may be he just wanted to confuse the uninitiated and to add an extra layer of secrecy via confusion a bit like he does by piling up ciphers in these later chapters anyway we are in luck the ishtar gate now lives in the pergamon museum in berlin and i happen to have a pass to the full collection i am not sure how they will feel about us dismantling it to try to find chapter seven but if we explain what is in it i suspect the curators curiosity will overcome his natural protectiveness perhaps there we will finally unlock the secret of the ixth legion that leaves the question of how we deal with midas and maryam has a clever idea we should let the collector deal with them the russian mafia can be pretty ruthless if they feel betrayed and she has suggested a way we might make the thieves fallout it is a cunning plan and i think i can help
