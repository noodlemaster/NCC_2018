charles is right the threats to the east are growing by the day in the southern region the ottomans are restless and in the north the three emperors are a growing threat to our influence the foreign office seem paralysed focussed entirely on forming alliances and unable to determine their best strategy i think they are mistaken in their outlook they focus too much on treaties and not enough on realpolitik as von rochau wrote the law of power governs the world of states just as the law of gravity governs the physical world and we are perhaps too much inclined to overlook there almight of the more powerful and the inevitability of its political influence our task now is not to choose a favoured partner to control the others that way risks war an alliance will encourage a counter alliance and a dangerous escalation instead our strategy should be to maintain an admittedly uneasy peace between the emperors to get her they are the biggest political threat to our empire but as enemies of one another they also threat enourtr ading routes we need to induce them to work to get her while preventing them from forming a power bloc against our interest our most important weapon in this is confusion and milddis trust the best outcome would be to encourage adys functional alliance between all three that makes it hard for the emperors to fight one another or us and in the ottoman crisis i think i sense an opportunity to do just that
